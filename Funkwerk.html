          Paul, or DJ Vulcan Fiber, made a mixtape including tracks from his friends and other artists he admired. He wanted a design to celebrate it, and his idea was to have it on the type of flag that is usually used for local football clubs and merch. Moreover he insisted on having all of their pictures and all of their logos included in the composition, which he provided. I drew inspiration from the covers of compilation CD’s one whould have for road trips or parties, and completed the illusion by using Planet Kosmos, a tacky typeface one can find on Dafont.com for which I have a soft spot. He was very happy with how it turned out and ordered 50 of them.        </p>
