            A frame and print made within the context of the Roots exhibition. Accompanying the work, I wrote the following complimentary text:

        <p class="italic">
            Our tools and technology are an extension of our human desires and goals. As a proud German owner of a Mercedes Benz, Romeo's grandfather was a prime example that the machine transcends its superficial purpose and embodies a symbol of character. In this case; a character of security, masculinity, and status, nevertheless intertwined with sensibility, humour and affection. Revisiting his distant memories as a grandchild going on rides, Romeo attempts to understand this awkward yet powerful relationship between man and machine, between the personality and the embodiment. By getting closer to the car, Romeo is getting closer to his grandfather.
